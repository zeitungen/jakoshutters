/**
 * A LocalStorage-based mutex. GuaranteesÂ¹ that only one browser window will be
 * able to execute the code inside the callback at a time.
 *
 * Based on the Alur and Taubenfeld fast lock
 * (http://www.cs.rochester.edu/research/synchronization/pseudocode/fastlock.html)
 * with an added timeout to ensure there will be eventual progress in the event
 * that a window is closed in the middle of the callback.
 *
 * 1. The guarantee assumes that the algorithm is correctly implemented.
 *    Additionally, I'm confident but not certain that this guarantee will hold
 *    in the event of a timeout.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *    LocalStorageMutex('some-key', function() {
 *      console.log('I hold the mutex!');
 *    });
